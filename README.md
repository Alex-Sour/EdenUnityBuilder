# Eden: Unity Builder Development
Open source remake/port of the game Eden World Builder for Android and PC.

Note: This wasn't started by me! The original creator has deleted the repo, and the Discord link for it no longer works.

Original game a block based building sandbox created by Ari Ronen for iOS.

## Getting Started
The game uses the Unity engine, so I recommend starting the project with Unity 2020.1.1f1. This should work on newer versions.
