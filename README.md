# Eden Unity Builder Open Source
Open source remake/port of the game Eden World Builder for Android and PC.
Original game a block based building sandbox created by Ari Ronen for iOS.

## Getting Started
The game uses the Unity engine, so I recommend starting the project with Unity 2020.1.1f1. This should work on newer versions.
