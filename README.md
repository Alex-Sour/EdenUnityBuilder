# Eden: Unity Builder Development
Open source remake/port of the game Eden World Builder for Android and PC.

Original game a block based building sandbox created by Ari Ronen for iOS.

## Getting Started
The game uses the Unity engine, so I recommend starting the project with Unity 2020.1.1f1. This should work on newer versions.

Better if you know the original game well, as I will only accept really useful changes in the main repository. Such as game mechanics that were in the World Builder, etc.
